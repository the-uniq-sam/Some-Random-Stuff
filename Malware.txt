A Malware, so the question that we're going to try to answer are, what is Malware, that was a Malware and how do we protect from it?
The first thing that we're going to do is to define it. Malicious code or malware is any undesired or unauthorized piece of software running on a host either to disrupt operations or to use the host resources for its benefit.
Recent malware attacks attempt to remain hidden on the host using resources for potential uses such as launching service attacks, hosting elicit data, accessing personal or business information.

Types of Malware, there are many forms of Malware out there with certain features. 

The same with a virus, which is a piece of malicious code that spreads from one computer to another by attaching itself to other files using self replication.
Note that they'd require human interaction to self replicate. Do to its self replicating nature, they are quite difficult to remove from a system. They also use tactics to hide on the system, like polymorphic code which encrypts and duplicates itself which makes it a little bit harder for the antivirus to find. This is known as a polymorphic virus.

Other category of a Malware virus which threatens to shield itself by obscuring the true location in the system. And its code make it harder to reverse engineer to create signatures for it.

Now, we have worms. Worms, it's a self-replicating Malware that does not require human interaction. Their main is goal is to just spread and cripple resources or turn computers into zombies.

Trojan Horses, also known as Trojans, is hiden Malware that causes damage to a system or gives an attack access to the host. They are usually introducted into the environment to a computer by posing as a vending package, such as a game, wallpaper, or any kind of download.

Spyware, the main goal of spyware is to track and report the usage of the host or to collect data that the attacker desires to obtain. It can include web browsing history, personal information, marketing information, any kind of files the attacker wants to chase.

Then we have adware. Adware, code that automatically displays or downloads unsolicited advertisements, usually seen on a browser pop up.

RATs, it stands for remote access tool or remote access trojans. RATs allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access and control the computer. 

Lastly, we have a rootkit. It's a piece of software that is intended to take full or partial control of a system at the lowest level. 

Now we have Ransomeware. We all hear about Ransomeware, but what really is Ransomeware? It's a malware that infects the host with a code that restricts the access to the computer or the data on it. The attacker demands a ransom to be paid to get the data back. If it's not paid then in that amount of time the data will be destroyed. On the right, we can see the banner where the Ransomware takes control of the host, asking for payment with a time.
