Timing and performance
-T0 upto -T5 according to speed and accuracy

Firewall and IDS Evasion(Spoofing)
-f Fragment packets to use tiny fragmented IP packets, the idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters/intrusion systems to detect the scan
--mtu  16 SPecifies the fragment size packet
-D use spoofed source addresses so the target will not know where the scan originated from.
-S Spoof a scan to trick victim thinking someone lese is scanning them
-g Specify source port(needs raw sockets).It help to bypass network filters and firewalls that are locked down. Common are FTP/DNS/Kerberos/DHCP
--proxies Run nmap scan through a proxy. It will break some functionality.
-oA outputs 3 (normal, XML and greppable)
