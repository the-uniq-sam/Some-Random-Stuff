first i try to run port with for loop but it did not work
then using nmap i find port using command
nmap -p T:31000-32000 -T4 localhost
echo cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790 > /tmp/key/b16
chmod 600 // because it was saying key as unprotective
ssh -i b16 bandit17@localhost //as in previous ones
and then
echo /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

and password is xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
